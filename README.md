Configuration templates for NYC Mesh

These configs drive [configgen.nycmesh.net](https://configgen.nycmesh.net). The tool[nycmesh-configgen](https://github.com/nycmeshnet/nycmesh-configgen) uses Github Releases to determine which configs are available. Don't forget to create a [new release](https://github.com/nycmeshnet/nycmesh-configs/releases) after merging changes!
